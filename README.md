### Hi there 👋

I am Luke, a developer based in Wellington New Zealand currently working at [Trade Me](https://trademe.co.nz) as a full stack developer and the owner of [Musicstax](https://musicstax.com).

I'm currently working across a number of projects to be released as [NuGet packages](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/lukemansell), and also creating development YouTube videos under the username [Pixelstax](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU8aZ_DVSJFkz0zCw9_aZyA).
